## What happened

- We started using the command pattern exposed by LocalGitRepo in production code. We have the Init and SetOrigin operations in place already.
- We decided to play with the "operation" name instead of "command" as we expect them to return values sometimes.
- We tried VS Code Live Share again. Still far from perfect (autocompletion is broken, following definitions and calls is broken, etc.)

## Insights

- Matt: I liked this long pairing session. I'm scared there is so much in my head about this codebase. It is nice to have shared a bit of it today.
- Julien: I found it quite easy to use the new command interface, but the live-share lacking featurese for following call definitions, or seeing autocomplete come up got in the way. Big loss!
- Matt: live share felt frictional to set up, but it was really nice when we could both type when we'd decided what to do and just needed to shovel text around.
- Matt: Maybe Zoom screen share *plus* live share is best of both worlds.

## Actions

- Crack on tomorrow morning!
